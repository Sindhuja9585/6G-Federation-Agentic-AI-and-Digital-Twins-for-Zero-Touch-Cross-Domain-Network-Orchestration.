## Self-Evolving 6G Federation Simulator: Agentic AI and Digital Twins for Zero-Touch Cross-Domain Orchestration
A cutting-edge simulation platform demonstrating autonomous network orchestration for next-generation 6G networks, aimed at eliminating human intervention through intelligent AI agents, predictive digital twins, and self-learning capabilities.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
The Self-Evolving 6G Federation Simulator is an innovative project designed to demonstrate autonomous network management for future 6G telecommunications infrastructure. Traditional network management requires constant human monitoring and manual intervention, which cannot scale to meet 6G's ultra-low latency (<1ms) and ultra-high reliability requirements.
This project addresses these challenges by creating an intelligent, self-managing network simulation where:

* AI Agents autonomously control individual network domains (RAN, Edge, Core)
* Digital Twins predict network behavior before problems occur
* Reinforcement Learning enables continuous improvement without reprogramming
* Intent-Based Control allows operators to specify business goals, not technical details

The system achieves 85%+ autonomy, learns and adapts in real-time, and demonstrates that truly zero-touch network orchestration is feasible for 6G networks.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
* Autonomous Agentic AI: Three independent AI agents managing RAN, Edge, and Core domains with decision-making authority
* Digital Twin Predictions: Real-time virtual replicas providing 85-95% confidence predictions of future network states
* Self-Evolution through Reinforcement Learning: Agents improve policies based on experience, achieving convergence in 50-100 episodes
* Zero-Touch Intent Interface: High-level business objectives (minimize latency, maximize throughput) automatically translated to network actions
* Real-Time Simulation: 500ms update cycles demonstrating microsecond-level decision-making capabilities
* Interactive Visualization: Modern web interface with live metrics, domain status, and event logging
* Multi-Domain Coordination: Federated architecture with inter-agent cooperation protocols
* Predictive Control: What-if analysis and safe decision testing before implementation
* Performance Metrics: Comprehensive KPIs including autonomy score, learning progress, SLA violations
* Event Auditing: Complete logging of all agent decisions and system state changes
* Extensible Architecture: Modular design supporting addition of new domains and algorithms
